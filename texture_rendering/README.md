There are several .wav files of the sound recording of different surface textures in the `surface_sound_record` directory (from [LMT dataset](https://zeus.lmt.ei.tum.de/downloads/texture/)). Some MATLAB programs used to preprocess the sound wave are also contained.

## How to run
Run `rendering_by_sound.py` to produce the vibration signals from sound recordings.

Run `rendering_by_sine.py` to produce the vibration using sine wave or constant gain.
